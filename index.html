                                <b>Hey! I’m Rakshith — a creative all-rounder with a passion for both the arts and technology. Whether it’s rapping a
                    rock tune, dancing to a beat, sketching vibrant art, or acting in front of the camera, I thrive on expression and
                    storytelling. I also love directing projects and editing various projects, especially when I get to bring my vision to life with a talented team of
                    collaborators.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond the creative side, I’m a big fan of gaming (you’ll find me in Minecraft as RKFyter), cooking up delicious dishes, playing sports like Cricket and Basketball
                    and writing code to build cool websites and apps. I believe in combining fun, passion, and skill in everything I do.
                    <br><br>
                    Together with my collaborators, I aim to create experiences that leave a mark — whether on a stage, a screen, or a server

                            <b> I have two channels featured in youtube, they are Ra-Ri Channel and Ra-Ri Clips <br><br>
                    Out of all the Projects, I feel like Youtube is the biggest one. <br><br>
                     It all started in 4th grade when I said, <q>I want to make a Youtube Channel</q> where my mother replied,<q>Ok, but what content will you feature in there?</q><br>
                Then in 6th grade, just before August 2021, I made a video called,<a href="https://youtu.be/jIgEpIKc44E?feature=shared"><q>Nutritious Milkshake</q></a> for a school project. But to send it there, Whatsapp will be a difficult option and so, my father helped me release that video on my mother's account. Then my father found out that all the entertaining videos can be sent to youtube as memories and thus <u>Ra-Ri Channel</u> is born. <br>
                 The logo and channel was created by my father<br><br> 
                 The first idea I thought to do was teaching Science. But then all changed to just simple and short videos of Arts and Crafts and Vlogs <br><br>
                 While Ra-Ri clips is a later channel, just used temporarily before it is shut down.

                    <dd><b><mark>Obsession</mark> is not just a story—it’s a descent. A fan writes letters to his idol, seeking recognition,
                    comfort, and connection. But with each word, his mind fractures, his admiration curdles into fixation. When the final
                    letter arrives, soaked in desperation and silence, a chilling truth emerges. The idol, Ramant, must face a twisted past,
                    a betrayal that runs deeper than fame—and a revenge that refuses to stay buried. Behind the spotlight lies something
                    darker. <br> You can read the story of <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/395064563-obsession-a-glory-or-a-misery">Obsession</a><br>
