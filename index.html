                    <b>Hey! I’m Rakshith — a creative all-rounder with a passion for both the arts and technology. Whether it’s rapping a
                    rock tune, dancing to a beat, sketching vibrant art, or acting in front of the camera, I thrive on expression and
                    storytelling. I also love directing projects and editing various projects, especially when I get to bring my vision to life with a talented team of
                    collaborators.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond the creative side, I’m a big fan of gaming (you’ll find me in Minecraft as RKFyter), cooking up delicious dishes, playing sports like Cricket and Basketball
                    and writing code to build cool websites and apps. I believe in combining fun, passion, and skill in everything I do.
                    <br><br>
                    Together with my collaborators, I aim to create experiences that leave a mark — whether on a stage, a screen, or a server</b>
